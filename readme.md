# 💘 Do You Like Me?

A fun and cheeky little website that asks the eternal question:
**"Do you like me?"** 😏

## 🎯 Features

* Two buttons: **Yes** and **No**
* If you click **Yes** – the site happily accepts your love 😍
* If you try to click **No** – good luck... the button just won’t cooperate! 😈
